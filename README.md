# RRTalgo
Implementation of a basic RRT algorithm in Python.

# Dependencies
This script makes use of the following libraries which can be installed using the pip command.
1. Treelib 
2. Scipy
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib

```
pip install treelib
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
As numpy and scipy are dependencies of treelib, they should automatically install.
Ensure that the python3-tk package is installed.
```
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
# Executing the script
Download the RRT.py script and run it from the terminal (Linux) or in Python 3 (Windows).
```
python3 RRT.py
```
In case it does not run (for Linux), navigate to the directory where RRT.py is stored and run in Terminal:
```
chmod +x RRT.py
```
and then run
```
python RRT.py
```
# Input
The scripts prompts the following input information:
1. Dimensions of the configuration space
2. (x,y) of the starting point
3. (x,y) of the destination point
4. Number of obstacles, and their dimensions.
5. Number of nodes to be generated by the RRT algorithm.

# Parameters
There are 2 paramters that can be tinkered with, according to the application.
1. Tolerance - the radius around the destination location, within which a node is accepted as the destination node.
2. Qdel - the step size, higher the step size, wider the spread of nodes

# Output
The RRT map is generated in blue and the obstacles are in red
1. If the goal is reached, the terminal prints Goal Reached! and the path is highlighted in Green.

2. If the goal is not reached, there is no path highlighted in green. The number of nodes or qdel must be altered to get a path.
